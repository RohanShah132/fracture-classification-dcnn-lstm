Knowledge-distilled DCNN-LSTM model for fracture classification on MURA dataset


# Fracture Classification Using DCNN-LSTM with Knowledge Distillation

This repository contains my Master's thesis project: a hybrid deep learning framework for fracture detection in shoulder, hand, and elbow X-rays using the MURA dataset. The project applies DCNN-LSTM architectures and a Teacher-Student model for efficient classification.

## Project Highlights

- Dataset: [MURA - Musculoskeletal Radiographs](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/)
- Techniques: 
  - Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Knowledge Distillation (Teacher-Student)
- Classification: Normal vs. Abnormal for 3 regions: Elbow, Hand, Shoulder
- Goal: Lightweight deep learning model for real-world clinical settings
